# 2.8.0

KIP(Kafka Improvement Proposals)

* KIP-500: which allows you to run Kafka brokers without Apache ZooKeeper, instead depending on an internal Raft implementation.
* KIP-700: decouples the AdminClient from the Metadata API by adding a new API to directly query the brokers for information about the cluster.
* KIP-684: support TLS client authentication for SASL_SSL listeners
