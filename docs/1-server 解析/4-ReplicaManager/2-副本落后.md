# isr shrink

副本收缩是 leader 发起的

``` scala
  def maybeShrinkIsr(): Unit = {
    val needsIsrUpdate = !isrState.isInflight && inReadLock(leaderIsrUpdateLock) {
      needsShrinkIsr()
    }
    val leaderHWIncremented = needsIsrUpdate && inWriteLock(leaderIsrUpdateLock) {
      leaderLogIfLocal.exists { leaderLog =>
        val outOfSyncReplicaIds = getOutOfSyncReplicas(replicaLagTimeMaxMs)
        if (outOfSyncReplicaIds.nonEmpty) {
          val outOfSyncReplicaLog = outOfSyncReplicaIds.map { replicaId =>
            s"(brokerId: $replicaId, endOffset: ${getReplicaOrException(replicaId).logEndOffset})"
          }.mkString(" ")
          val newIsrLog = (isrState.isr -- outOfSyncReplicaIds).mkString(",")
          info(s"Shrinking ISR from ${isrState.isr.mkString(",")} to $newIsrLog. " +
               s"Leader: (highWatermark: ${leaderLog.highWatermark}, endOffset: ${leaderLog.logEndOffset}). " +
               s"Out of sync replicas: $outOfSyncReplicaLog.")

          shrinkIsr(outOfSyncReplicaIds)

          // we may need to increment high watermark since ISR could be down to 1
          maybeIncrementLeaderHW(leaderLog)
        } else {
          false
        }
      }
    }

    // some delayed operations may be unblocked after HW changed
    if (leaderHWIncremented)
      tryCompleteDelayedRequests()
  }
```

当前节点的 partition 是 leader，获取 partition 当前的 isr follower，返回已经落后的 follower

``` scala
  /**
   * If the follower already has the same leo as the leader, it will not be considered as out-of-sync,
   * otherwise there are two cases that will be handled here -
   * 1. Stuck followers: If the leo of the replica hasn't been updated for maxLagMs ms,
   *                     the follower is stuck and should be removed from the ISR
   * 2. Slow followers: If the replica has not read up to the leo within the last maxLagMs ms,
   *                    then the follower is lagging and should be removed from the ISR
   * Both these cases are handled by checking the lastCaughtUpTimeMs which represents
   * the last time when the replica was fully caught up. If either of the above conditions
   * is violated, that replica is considered to be out of sync
   *
   * If an ISR update is in-flight, we will return an empty set here
   **/
  def getOutOfSyncReplicas(maxLagMs: Long): Set[Int] = {
    val current = isrState
    if (!current.isInflight) {
      val candidateReplicaIds = current.isr - localBrokerId
      val currentTimeMs = time.milliseconds()
      val leaderEndOffset = localLogOrException.logEndOffset
      candidateReplicaIds.filter(replicaId => isFollowerOutOfSync(replicaId, leaderEndOffset, currentTimeMs, maxLagMs))
    } else {
      Set.empty
    }
  }
```

如果 follower 的 leo 不等于 leader 的 leo，且 follower 的 lastCaughtUpTimeMs 距当前时间超过 `replica.lag.time.max.ms`，则认为其落后

``` scala
  private def isFollowerOutOfSync(replicaId: Int,
                                  leaderEndOffset: Long,
                                  currentTimeMs: Long,
                                  maxLagMs: Long): Boolean = {
    val followerReplica = getReplicaOrException(replicaId)
    followerReplica.logEndOffset != leaderEndOffset &&
      (currentTimeMs - followerReplica.lastCaughtUpTimeMs) > maxLagMs
  }
```
